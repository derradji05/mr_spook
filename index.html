I returned to my solitude so that I would not come to see you by chance anywhere in this obnoxious world
i am <span style="color: red; font-style: italic"> Derradji </span> <span style="color: #00FF00; font-style: italic">Director</span> of this site 
</br>I used to be a weak and stupid person who loves the good of all but time changes everything
Now I became a new person Ahamh something isolated from </br>the world does not want anyone just wants a dark room and closed to no one enters and </br>wants a computer illuminates most of the room light
</br>My family is not the example that you wish but the days passed </br>and some times were only burning memories
The first time </br>I loved a girl was in <span style="color: blue; font-style: italic">12/10/2015</span> was a day I did not imagine that I will live one day</br> because it was my first experience as I think
The days passed and I thought it would never let me down,</br> but the days showed me the opposite
</br>I went into a breakdown from within my feelings </br>but I didn't show it to anyone
The days passed and my heart appeared </br>in the petrification and </br>I got a strong desire to destroy all society, but I was not a muscle group,</br> so I had a talent from a young age I was making things and </br>I maintain them, but I developed them to penetrate
I learned a little with the help of myself because no one wanted to teach me,</br> but they were laughing at my condition
I learned by myself and spent all the people </br> who were laughing at it was the beginning of my fame in penetration
And some people couldn't stand my talent, </br>so they created some problems for me and my family, </br>but they didn't do anything because I wiped them from the sites.
Not only did I end up here, </br>but I developed myself even more so that </br>I became a robot in mental engineering
I became a </br>programmer and developed myself so </br>creatively in making major hacking tools
